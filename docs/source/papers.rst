There are numerous papers which describes the analyses availabe in the
Simple-PE repository.

Localization
------------

Codes for localization of sources are based upon the methods developed in the
papers:
  * `Triangulation of gravitational wave sources with a network of detectors
    <https://doi.org/10.1088/1367-2630/11/12/123006>`_

  * `Source localization with an advanced gravitational wave detector network
    <https://doi.org/10.1088/0264-9381/28/10/105021>`_

  * `Localization of transient gravitational wave sources: beyond
    triangulation <https://doi.org/10.1088/1361-6382/aab675>`_

Results from these analyses are presented in the above papers and also
  * `Improved source localization with LIGO India <https://doi.org/10
    .1088/1742-6596/484/1/012007>`_

  * `Localization of binary neutron star mergers with second and third
    generation gravitational-wave detectors <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD
    .97.104064>`_

  * `Prospects for Observing and Localizing Gravitational-Wave Transients
    with Advanced LIGO and Advanced Virgo <https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0670v3>`_

  * `Comparison of Gravitational Wave Detector Network Sky Localization
    Approximations <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.89.042004>`_


Parameter Estimation
--------------------

The simple-pe analysis is described in the paper
  * `Fast inference of binary merger properties using the information
    encoded in the gravitational-wave signal <https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv
    .2304.03731>`_

The method brings together insights developed in earlier papers, including
the localization work above and also:
  * `Degeneracy between mass and spin in black-hole-binary waveforms
    <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.87.024035>`_

  * `Constraining the Inclinations of Binary Mergers from
    Gravitational-wave Observations <https://doi.org/10.3847/1538-4357/ab0b3e>`_

  * `Two-harmonic approximation for gravitational waveforms from precessing
    binaries <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.102.024055>`_

  * `Measuring gravitational-wave higher-order multipoles <https://doi
    .org/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.024042>`_
