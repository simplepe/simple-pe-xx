Analysing GW150914
==================

Below we analyse GW150914 through the :code:`simple-pe-pipe` executable. The following script can be used:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/GW150914/GW150914.sh
    :language: bash
    :linenos:

.. note::

    The auxillary data can be downloaded from [here](https://git.ligo.org/stephen-fairhurst/simple-pe/-/tree/main/examples/GW150914).

Below is a corner plot showing the obtained posterior distribution when using the :code:`IMRPhenomXPHM` waveform model:

.. image:: ./images/IMRPhenomXPHM_GW150914_corner.png

and below is a corner plot showing the obtained posterior distribution when using the :code:`IMRPhenomTPHM` waveform model:

.. image:: ./images/IMRPhenomTPHM_GW150914_corner.png

Both of these analyses were performed as part of :code:`simple-pe`'s continuous integration and are therefore using the latest version of the code.
