Analysing GW150914
==================
.. _gw150914_example:

For a brief overview of the analysis and results on a simulated signal, see
:ref:`zero_noise_injection`.

Below we analyse the first observed gravitational-wave signal, GW150914 (`Phys
.Rev.Lett. 116 (2016) 6,061102 <https://doi
.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102>`_,
`Phys.Rev.Lett. 116 (2016) 24,241102
<https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.241102>`_), using the
:code:`simple_pe_pipe` executable. The following config file can be used:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/GW150914/config.ini
    :language: ini
    :linenos:

and this can be launched with:

.. code-block:: bash

    simple_pe_pipe config.ini

Here, we specify the time of the event based upon the event identifier in the
`GWOSC <https://gwosc.org/>`_ database.  The :code:`trigger_parameters` file
contains the approximate parameters of the event, which are used to seed the
optimization routine.  The :code:`asd` dictionary contains pointers to the
instrumental sensitivity curves.

.. note::

    The auxiliary data can be downloaded from `here <https://git.ligo
    .org/stephen-fairhurst/simple-pe/-/tree/main/examples/GW150914>`_.

Below is a corner plot showing the obtained posterior distribution when
using the :code:`IMRPhenomXPHM` waveform model (`Phys.Rev.D 103 (2021) 10,
104056 <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.104056>`_):

.. image:: ./images/IMRPhenomXPHM_GW150914_corner.png

and below is a corner plot showing the obtained posterior distribution when
using the :code:`IMRPhenomTPHM` waveform model (`Phys.Rev.D 105 (2022) 8,
084040 <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.084040>`_):

Both of these analyses were performed as part of :code:`simple-pe`'s
continuous integration and are therefore using the latest version of the code.

    This research has made use of data or software obtained from the
    Gravitational Wave Open Science Center (gwosc.org), a service of the LIGO
    Scientific Collaboration, the Virgo Collaboration, and KAGRA. This material
    is based upon work supported by NSF's LIGO Laboratory which is a major
    facility fully funded by the National Science Foundation, as well as the
    Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC) of the United Kingdom, the
    Max-Planck-Society (MPS), and the State of Niedersachsen/Germany for support
    of the construction of Advanced LIGO and construction and operation of the
    GEO600 detector. Additional support for Advanced LIGO was provided by the
    Australian Research Council. Virgo is funded, through the European
    Gravitational Observatory (EGO), by the French Centre National de Recherche
    Scientifique (CNRS), the Italian Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare
    (INFN) and the Dutch Nikhef, with contributions by institutions from
    Belgium, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Japan, Monaco, Poland, Portugal,
    Spain. KAGRA is supported by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science
    and Technology (MEXT), Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) in
    Japan; National Research Foundation (NRF) and Ministry of Science and ICT
    (MSIT) in Korea; Academia Sinica (AS) and National Science and Technology
    Council (NSTC) in Taiwan.
