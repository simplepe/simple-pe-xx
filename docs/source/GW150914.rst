Analysing GW150914
==================

Below we analyse GW150914 (`Phys.Rev.Lett. 116 (2016) 6,061102 <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.061102>`_, `Phys.Rev.Lett. 116 (2016) 24,241102 <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.116.241102>`_) through the :code:`simple_pe_pipe` executable. The following config file can be used:

.. literalinclude:: ../../examples/GW150914/config.ini
    :language: ini
    :linenos:

and this can be launched with:

.. code-block:: bash

    simple_pe_pipe config.ini

.. note::

    The auxillary data can be downloaded from `here <https://git.ligo.org/stephen-fairhurst/simple-pe/-/tree/main/examples/GW150914>`_.

Below is a corner plot showing the obtained posterior distribution when using the :code:`IMRPhenomXPHM` waveform model (`Phys.Rev.D 103 (2021) 10,104056 <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.103.104056>`_):

and below is a corner plot showing the obtained posterior distribution when using the :code:`IMRPhenomTPHM` waveform model (`Phys.Rev.D 105 (2022) 8,084040 <https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevD.105.084040>`_):

Both of these analyses were performed as part of :code:`simple-pe`'s continuous integration and are therefore using the latest version of the code.
